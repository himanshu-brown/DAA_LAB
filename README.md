Brief introduction of Sorting algorithm

<h3>Comparison Sort Algorithm</h3> - In comparison based sorting, elements of an array are compared with each other to find the sorted array.<br>
                - Bubble Sort<br>
                - Insertion Sort<br>
                - Selection Sort<br>
                - Merge Sort<br>
                - Heap Sort<br>
                - Quick Sort<br><br>
                
 <h3>Non-Comparison Sort</h3> - In non-comparison based sorting, elements of array are not compared with each other to find the sorted array.<br>
                - Radix Sort<br>
                - Counting Sort<br>
                - Bucket Sort<br>
